6. **NEW:** Pop-up auto-closes
7. ✅ Parent can review logs of attempts
8. ✅ Family rules stay enforced

**Result:** Parents get visual feedback + transparency for families

## 🎨 Visual Design Details

### Colors
- **Background:** `#FF1a1a1a` (dark gray)
- **Text:** Red (`#FF0000`)
- **Shadow:** Red with 20px blur, 0.8 opacity
- **Border:** Transparent (no visible frame)

### Layout
- **Width:** 450px
- **Height:** 250px

- **Font Sizes:** 72px (icon), 28px (title), 14px (text), 11px (countdown)

### Behavior

- **Duration:** 3 seconds (auto-closes)
- **Position:** CenterScreen (Windows default)
- **Layer:** Topmost (always on top of game)
- **Taskbar:** Hidden (ShowInTaskbar=False)

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Thread Model
```
Monitor Thread (background)
    ├─ Reads Roblox logs continuously
    ├─ Detects blocked games
    └─ Calls OnGameDetected()
        └─ Spawns Alert Thread (doesn't block)
            └─ Creates AlertWindow
                ├─ Shows UI via ShowDialog()
                ├─ Waits for user/timer
                └─ Returns (cleans up)

Monitor Thread continues working (no blocking) ✅
```

### Error Handling
```csharp
try {
    // Create STA thread
    var thread = new Thread(() => {
        try {
            var alert = new AlertWindow();
            alert.ShowDialog();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // Log and continue
        }
    });
    thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
    thread.Start();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Log and continue (monitor doesn't crash)
}
```

**Result:** Graceful degradation at every level
