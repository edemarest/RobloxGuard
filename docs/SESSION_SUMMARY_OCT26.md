## Next Implementation Phase (Ready to Start)

### Feature 1: After-Hours Soft Disconnect (Ty's Bedtime) ‚è∞
**Effort:** 5-6 hours | **Testability:** HIGH ‚úÖ | **Risk:** LOW ‚úÖ

**What It Does:**
- Between 3:00-3:30 AM: 65% probability disconnect
- Smart logic: Max 2 consecutive days, day 3 forced allow
- Graceful close + force kill (reuses Phase 1 code)

**How to Test:**
- Config `softDisconnectTestMode = true`
- Set check interval to 1 minute (instead of 3 AM)
- Verify counter logic with 3-day cycle

---

### Feature 2: Inactivity Monitoring (Sol's RNG) üïê
**Effort:** 6-7 hours | **Testability:** MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è | **Risk:** MEDIUM ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What It Does:**
- Monitor keyboard/mouse input
- Disconnect after 1-2 hours inactivity on specific game
- Skip quiet hours (3:30-9:00 AM) to avoid interference
- Graceful close + force kill (reuses Phase 1 code)

**How to Test:**
- Config `inactivityTestMode = true`
- Set inactivity threshold to 1 minute (instead of 60)
- Verify quiet hours suppress disconnect

---

## Why These Two Features?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Reuse Phase 1** | Force kill + cleanup infrastructure already proven |
| **Config-Driven** | Easy to test, disable, and adjust |
| **Time-Compressible** | Can test with 1-minute intervals instead of hours |
| **Parallelizable** | Can develop both simultaneously |
| **User Value** | Visible behavior, easy to demonstrate |
| **Low Risk** | Both have kill switches, comprehensive logging |

1. **Config fields** - Ready to copy/paste
2. **PlaytimeTracker methods** - Full implementations provided
3. **InputMonitor class** - Complete Windows hook code
4. **LogMonitor integration** - Integration points shown

---

## Testing Strategy

### Feature 1 Testing
```powershell
# Set test mode with compressed time
$config.softDisconnectTestMode = true
$config.afterHoursSoftDisconnectProbability = 100

# Wait 1 minute, game should disconnect
# Verify logs: /AppData/Local/RobloxGuard/launcher.log
```

### Feature 2 Testing
```powershell
# Set test mode with 1-minute inactivity
$config.inactivityTestMode = true
$config.inactivityDisconnectMinutes = 1

# Don't move mouse/keyboard for 1 minute
# Game should disconnect
# Verify logs for inactivity duration calculation
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Feature 1 (LOW RISK) ‚úÖ
- Pure logic, no system APIs
- Config killswitch: `afterHoursSoftDisconnectEnabled = false`
- Easy to test and verify
- Reuses proven Phase 1 infrastructure

### Feature 2 (MEDIUM RISK) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Uses Windows API hooks (user32.dll)
- Mitigations:
  - Graceful cleanup on stop
  - Error handling around hook failures
  - Config killswitch: `inactivityDisconnectEnabled = false`
  - Can disable in production if issues found

---

## Recommendations

1. **Start Tomorrow**
   - Phase 0 (Config) is a quick 30-minute task
   - Gets both Features ready to work on

2. **Parallelize**
   - Don't wait for Feature 1 to finish
   - Start Feature 2 while testing Feature 1
   - Both features are independent

3. **Test Early**
   - Use config test mode with compressed intervals
   - Can iterate quickly (test disconnects in 1 minute)
   - Better to catch issues early

4. **Document As You Go**
   - Add logging at every decision point
   - Makes debugging easier
   - Helps with future maintenance

5. **Deploy with Confidence**
   - Both features have kill switches
   - Can disable immediately if issues arise
   - Phase 1 foundation is rock-solid

---

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Feature 1 Timing**
   - Should disconnect time be randomized daily? (YES - already designed)
   - Should probability be configurable? (YES - 0-100%)
   - Should counter reset after 3 days? (YES - auto-resets)

2. **Feature 2 Timing**
   - What inactivity threshold? (Recommended: 60 minutes, but configurable)
   - Should quiet hours be per-place or global? (Recommendation: Global)
   - What input counts as activity? (Current: Mouse click/drag + keyboard)

3. **Logging**
   - How verbose should logs be? (Recommendation: Very verbose for Phase 2)
   - Where should they go? (Same location: AppData/Local/RobloxGuard/launcher.log)
   - Should test mode have different log level? (Recommendation: Yes, more verbose)

## Final Checklist

### Before Starting Phase 2
- [ ] Read `IMPLEMENTATION_QUICK_GUIDE.md` (15 min)
- [ ] Understand config schema changes (10 min)
- [ ] Review code examples (15 min)
- [ ] Set up local test environment
- [ ] Create feature branch for each feature

### During Implementation
- [ ] Keep test configs separate from production
- [ ] Test as you code (1-minute intervals)
- [ ] Log all decision points
- [ ] Document any deviations from guide

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All features compile cleanly
- [ ] Test with compressed time (1 min intervals)
- [ ] Test with production time configs
- [ ] Verify logging is comprehensive
- [ ] Code review complete
- [ ] Both features can be independently disabled

## Bottom Line

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE.** ‚úÖ Force kill works, cleanup is done, code compiles.

**Phase 2 is READY TO START.** üöÄ Config, code examples, and strategy all documented.

**Estimated Duration:** 5-7 business days of focused development

**Risk Level:** Low to Medium (well-mitigated with kill switches)

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 0 (Config Schema) - 30 minutes of work to unblock parallel development
