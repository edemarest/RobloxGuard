## v1.3.0 - Windows Forms Alert with Dramatic Styling

### Major Changes
**Fixed DLL dependency issues** by completely switching from WPF to Windows Forms for the alert window.

### What's New
- **Windows Forms alert window** - Fewer dependencies, works on more systems
- **Dramatic visual styling** with pulsing/flashing red text
- **Large emojis** (80pt brain üß† and X ‚ùå)
- **Red border effect** around the entire window for maximum visibility
- **Dark background** with high contrast for easy reading
- **Flashing text** effect - main message alternates between bright red and dark red every 600ms
- **Better error handling** - falls back to MessageBox if form creation fails

### Why This Matters
Previous WPF alert window would crash with `DllNotFoundException` on systems missing certain Windows components. This version uses Windows Forms, which has been part of .NET since the beginning and has minimal dependencies.

### Visual Features
- Large flashing "BRAINDEAD CONTENT DETECTED" text
- Brain (üß†) + X (‚ùå) emojis at the top
- Red border framing the entire alert
- Status text explaining what happened
- 20-second countdown until auto-close
- Always on top of other windows
- Centered on screen
