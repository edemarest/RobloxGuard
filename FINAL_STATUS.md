## 📊 Current Setup

### You are currently on:
```bash
$ git branch
* feature/discord-notification-monitor
  main
```

### Branch timeline:
```
v1.5.0 (c928a00) - Original RobloxGuard
    ↓
15da447 - Add comprehensive analysis
    ↓
a05ca31 - Add analysis completion summary [on main + pushed]
    ↓
020c8b1 - Add setup completion guide [on discord branch + pushed]
```

### Files created:
```

## 🚀 Ready to Implement

### To Start Phase 1 Right Now:

```bash
# You're on the discord branch ✅
git status

# Read the quick reference
cat QUICK_REFERENCE.md

# Open the implementation spec
cat docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md

# Start editing RobloxGuardConfig.cs
# Follow Phase 1 instructions
```

### The 5 Phases:

**Phase 1 (Config)** - 1-2 hours
→ Remove playtime settings, add Discord settings in RobloxGuardConfig.cs

**Phase 2 (LogMonitor)** - 2-3 hours
→ Simplify main loop, add DiscordNotificationListener init

**Phase 3 (Listener)** - 2-3 hours
→ Implement DiscordNotificationListener.cs (new file)

**Phase 4 (Integration)** - 1-2 hours
→ Connect listener to LogMonitor, hook to RobloxRestarter

**Phase 5 (Cleanup)** - 1 hour
→ Delete PlaytimeTracker, update documentation

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### Why This Refactor

**Current (Bad):**
- Time-based enforcement
- Child knows when game closes
- Less effective control

**New (Good):**
- Event-driven (Discord notifications)
- Child can't predict game closure
- More effective control
- Simpler code

### What's Different

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Scheduling | PlaytimeTracker (~650 LOC) | ❌ Removed | -650 LOC |
| Triggering | Time-based polling | ✨ Event-driven | +200-300 LOC |
| Control | Automatic | Parent-initiated | Much better |
| Predictability | High (time-based) | Low (event-driven) | More effective |

### What Stays the Same

✅ Game detection (PlaceIdParser)  
✅ Graceful kill/restart (RobloxRestarter)  
✅ Session persistence (SessionStateManager)  
✅ Watchdog monitoring (health checks)  
✅ Alert UI (AlertForm)  
✅ Core reliability & durability

## 🔄 How to Use the Branches

### Main Branch
- **Purpose:** Production documentation base
- **Contains:** All analysis documents
- **Status:** Stable, well-documented
- **Action:** Don't implement here; merge discord when complete

### Discord Branch
- **Purpose:** Development/implementation
- **Contains:** All analysis + ready for Phase 1
- **Status:** Current (you are here)
- **Action:** Do all implementation here, then merge to main

### Workflow:
```bash
# On discord branch, implement phases 1-5
git add <files>
git commit -m "Phase X: description"
git push origin feature/discord-notification-monitor

# After all phases complete:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/discord-notification-monitor
git push origin main
```
