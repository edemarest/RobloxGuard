# LogMonitor Performance Fix - October 20, 2025

## Problem Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è
During testing, you were able to **join a blocked game** before LogMonitor could close it.

**Why this happened:**
- Game launches in ~100-200ms
- LogMonitor was polling every 500ms
- By the time LogMonitor detected the game join log entry, you were already in the game

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### Change 1: Reduce Polling Interval
- **Before:** 500ms between log checks
- **After:** 100ms between log checks
- **Impact:** LogMonitor now detects game joins 5x faster

```csharp
// Old: await Task.Delay(500, cancellationToken);
// New: await Task.Delay(100, cancellationToken);
```

### Change 2: Aggressive Process Termination
- **Before:** Graceful close (CloseMainWindow) then wait 2 seconds before kill
- **After:** Immediate force kill with child processes
- **Impact:** Game process terminated instantly without delay

```csharp
// Old approach (slow):
proc.CloseMainWindow();
if (!proc.WaitForExit(2000)) { proc.Kill(); }

// New approach (fast):
proc.Kill(true); // Force kill immediately
```

## Expected Improvement

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Detection Delay | ~500ms | ~100ms | **5x faster** |
| Process Kill Time | 0-2000ms | ~5ms | **400x faster** |
| **Total Block Time** | **2.5+ seconds** | **~105ms** | **~24x faster** ‚úÖ |

**Result:** Games should now be blocked **BEFORE you can join them**, not after.

## Files Modified

```
src/RobloxGuard.Core/LogMonitor.cs
- Line 74: Changed await Task.Delay(500) ‚Üí await Task.Delay(100)
- Lines 184-211: Rewrote TerminateRobloxProcess()
  ‚Ä¢ Removed graceful close
  ‚Ä¢ Added immediate force kill
  ‚Ä¢ Improved error handling with debug logging
```

## Testing Steps

### Quick Test
1. **Open LogMonitor** (‚úÖ Already running)
2. **Open Roblox app**
3. **Click Play on blocked game (1818 or 93978595733734)**
4. **Expected:** Game immediately closes (before you see the loading screen)
5. **Terminal shows:** `‚ùå BLOCKED: Game XXXX` (within ~100ms)

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Game does NOT launch for blocked games
- ‚úÖ Blocked game closes before entering
- ‚úÖ Allowed games still launch normally
- ‚úÖ No crashes or errors

## Build & Deploy Status

```
‚úÖ Build: Successful (0 errors, 49 warnings)
‚úÖ Tests: 36/36 passing
‚úÖ Publish: Updated to %LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard
‚úÖ New Monitor: Running with updated code
```

## How It Works (Optimized)

```
Timeline of Game Launch Attempt:
‚îú‚îÄ T=0ms: User clicks "Play" on game 1818
‚îú‚îÄ T=50ms: Roblox writes log: "! Joining game 'UUID' place 1818 at X.X.X.X"
‚îú‚îÄ T=100ms: LogMonitor polls log ‚Üê DETECTS IMMEDIATELY
‚îú‚îÄ T=100ms: LogMonitor checks blocklist ‚Üê 1818 IS BLOCKED
‚îú‚îÄ T=100ms: LogMonitor kills RobloxPlayerBeta ‚Üê PROCESS TERMINATED
‚îú‚îÄ T=150ms: Game startup interrupted
‚îî‚îÄ T=200ms: Terminal shows: "‚ùå BLOCKED: Game 1818"

Result: Game NEVER reaches playable state ‚úÖ
```

## Ready to Test

The updated LogMonitor is now running with:
- ‚úÖ 100ms polling (5x faster detection)
- ‚úÖ Immediate process kill (no delays)
- ‚úÖ Same blocklist checking
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling
