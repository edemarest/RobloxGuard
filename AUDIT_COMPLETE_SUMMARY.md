## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: PowerShell Checksum Path Duplication ❌→✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Build would fail with "Access denied"  
**Fix Applied**: Rewrote checksum step with explicit directory collection  
**Commit**: `fa04c97`  

```powershell
# BEFORE (broken):
Get-ChildItem out\publish, build\inno\Output -Recurse
# Results in: build\inno\build\inno\Output (path doubled!)

# AFTER (fixed):
$files = @()
$files += Get-ChildItem out\publish -Recurse -File
$files += Get-ChildItem build\inno\Output -Recurse -File -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Now: Correct paths, proper error handling
```

---

### Issue #2: PowerShell Invocation Syntax Error ❌→✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Installer build would fail  
**Fix Applied**: Added invocation operator `&` with proper quoting  
**Commit**: `e7642f9`  

```yaml
# BEFORE (broken):
run: '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" .\build\inno\RobloxGuard.iss'
# Error: Unexpected token

# AFTER (fixed):
run: |
  & "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" ".\build\inno\RobloxGuard.iss"
# Now: Proper invocation with quoted arguments
```

---

### Issue #3: Inno Setup Path Traversal Error ❌→✅

**File**: `build/inno/RobloxGuard.iss`  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Installer would not find published EXE  
**Fix Applied**: Changed relative path from `out\publish\*` to `..\..\out\publish\*`  
**Commit**: `61683b7`  

```ini
# BEFORE (broken):
Source: "out\publish\*"
# Looked in: build/inno/out/publish/ (wrong!)

# AFTER (fixed):
Source: "..\..\out\publish\*"
# Looked in: out/publish/ (correct!)
```
