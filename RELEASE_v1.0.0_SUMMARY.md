## Architecture Simplification Recap

### Removed (Redundant Components)

| Component | Location | Lines | Reason |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| ProcessWatcher.cs | src/RobloxGuard.Core/ | 165 | WMI-based monitoring unnecessary with LogMonitor |
| HandlerLock.cs | src/RobloxGuard.Core/ | 225 | Registry surveillance not needed |
| --watch handler | Program.cs | ~40 | Fallback mechanism no longer required |
| --lock-handler handler | Program.cs | ~40 | Optimization removed |
| OnProcessBlocked() | Program.cs | ~10 | Dead code |
| OnHandlerLockEvent() | Program.cs | ~20 | Dead code |
| LockProtocolHandler() | Program.cs | ~25 | Dead code |
| ShowHelp() entries | Program.cs | 2 | Obsolete options |
| **Total Removed** | | **~527** | |

### Kept (Core Functionality ‚úÖ)

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **LogMonitor.cs** | Real-time log monitoring for game detection | ‚úÖ ENHANCED |
| **Protocol Handler** | Intercept web clicks | ‚úÖ ACTIVE |
| **Block UI** | Show when game is blocked | ‚úÖ ACTIVE |
| **Settings UI** | Configure blocklist & PIN | ‚úÖ ACTIVE |
| **PlaceIdParser.cs** | Extract placeId from URI/CLI | ‚úÖ WORKING |
| **ConfigManager.cs** | Manage blocklist & config | ‚úÖ WORKING |

### Why Simplification is Safe

**LogMonitor provides 100% coverage:**
1. **Web Clicks:** Protocol handler processes all `roblox://` links
2. **CLI Launches:** LogMonitor detects game joins from Roblox logs
3. **Direct Invocation:** Log file monitoring catches all scenarios
4. **Teleports:** In-game teleports are logged by Roblox
5. **Third-Party Apps:** Any app that launches Roblox generates logs

**Fallback mechanisms were for unreliability:**
- Process Watcher (WMI polling) was emergency backup when LogMonitor was flaky
- Handler Lock (registry watching) was defensive measure
- With FileShare.ReadWrite fix, LogMonitor is reliable enough
- No need for backup systems anymore

**Code quality improves:**
- Fewer moving parts = fewer bugs
- Less surface area for attacks
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Clearer execution path

## Release Workflow Activation

### What Happens Next (Automated by GitHub Actions)

When tag `v1.0.0` is pushed, the `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow automatically:

1. **Checks out code** (latest tag)
2. **Restores NuGet** packages
3. **Builds** with Release config
4. **Runs tests** (all 36 must pass)
5. **Publishes** single-file executable
6. **Installs Inno Setup** compiler
7. **Builds installer** (RobloxGuardInstaller.exe)
8. **Generates checksums** (SHA256)
9. **Verifies artifacts** exist
10. **Creates GitHub Release** with files attached
11. **Uploads** RobloxGuard.exe, installer, checksums

### Expected Output

```
GitHub Release: v1.0.0
‚îú‚îÄ RobloxGuard.exe (52.7 MB)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Single-file executable
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Win-x64 architecture
