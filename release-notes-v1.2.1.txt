## v1.2.1 - Fix Monitor Crash When Alert Shows

### Critical Fix
Fixed a bug where the log monitor would crash and stop when showing the alert window after detecting a blocked game.

### What Was Fixed
- **Monitor crash after blocking a game**: The monitor would silently exit after successfully killing a blocked game process
- **Alert window not appearing**: The window creation was crashing the monitor thread
- **No error visibility**: Unhandled exceptions in the WPF alert thread were killing the entire monitor process

### Changes
- **Global exception handlers**: Added `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` handler to catch any unhandled exceptions
- **Dispatcher exception handler**: Added WPF dispatcher handler to prevent UI thread crashes from terminating the app
- **Thread safety improvements**: Each exception handler logs to file before any crash occurs
- **Monitor lifecycle logging**: Comprehensive logging for all monitor operations (start, game detection, blocking, termination)
- **Alert thread isolation**: Alert window failures now log detailed errors but don't affect the monitor
- **Graceful degradation**: If AlertWindow fails, system attempts fallback MessageBox, and monitor continues

### How to Test
1. Download and run `RobloxGuard.exe` (auto-installs on first run)
2. Join a blocked game in Roblox
3. The game should close immediately
4. The alert window should appear (red "BRAINDEAD CONTENT DETECTED")
5. **Most importantly**: The monitor should continue running in the background
6. Check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\launcher.log` to see detailed operation logs

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Game closes when blocked
- [ ] Alert window appears (or fallback MessageBox if unavailable)
- [ ] Monitor continues running after alert
- [ ] Can block multiple games in sequence
- [ ] Check launcher.log for "Monitor continues" messages
