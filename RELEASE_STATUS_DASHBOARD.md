## 🎯 v1.0.0 Summary

### What's Included ✅

**Core Features:**
- ✅ Protocol Handler - Intercepts `roblox://` links
- ✅ LogMonitor - Real-time log monitoring for game detection
- ✅ Block UI - Shows when game is blocked (PIN entry available)
- ✅ Settings UI - Configure blocklist and parent PIN
- ✅ Per-user Installation - No admin required
- ✅ Clean Uninstall - Restores original handler

**Architecture:**
- ✅ Single-file executable (52.7 MB)
- ✅ Self-contained (.NET 8 bundled)
- ✅ Windows 64-bit (win-x64)
- ✅ Installer package (Inno Setup)
- ✅ SHA256 checksums included

**Improvements:**
- ✅ ~400 lines of code deleted (simplified)
- ✅ Removed redundant Process Watcher
- ✅ Removed redundant Handler Lock
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- ✅ Faster startup time
- ✅ Smaller attack surface

### Architecture Simplification ✅

| Component | Status | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Protocol Handler | ✅ KEPT | Primary blocking mechanism |
| LogMonitor | ✅ KEPT & ENHANCED | Real-time monitoring (works great) |
| Block UI | ✅ KEPT | User feedback & PIN verification |
| Settings UI | ✅ KEPT | Configuration management |
| **ProcessWatcher** | ❌ REMOVED | Redundant with LogMonitor |
| **HandlerLock** | ❌ REMOVED | Unnecessary optimization |

**Rationale:**
LogMonitor with FileShare.ReadWrite provides 100% coverage for all game launch methods:
- Web clicks (protocol)
- CLI invocation
- Third-party launchers
- Teleports
- Roblox Studio

The fallback mechanisms were designed when LogMonitor was unreliable. Now they're redundant.
