# üéØ BREAKTHROUGH: Log-Based Game Detection for App Launch Blocking

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Discovery:** Roblox logs placeId when joining games  
**Impact:** Complete solution for app launch blocking WITHOUT admin, WMI, or command-line args

---

## The Discovery

### What We Found

When you launch a game from the Roblox app, Roblox writes to its player log:

```
2025-10-20T04:39:40.252Z,8.252423,3d38,6 [FLog::Output] ! Joining game 'cfbd5c4e-7709-4306-b1b0-7fee671d7792' place 93978595733734 at 10.18.9.6
```

**Key Pattern:** `! Joining game '...' place <PLACEID> at ...`

### Why This is Perfect

‚úÖ **PlaceId is clearly visible in logs**  
‚úÖ **Logs are created immediately when game is selected**  
‚úÖ **Works for ANY game launch method (website, app, direct)**  
‚úÖ **NO admin required - log files are user-accessible**  
‚úÖ **NO WMI needed - just file system monitoring**  
‚úÖ **NO command-line parsing needed - explicit in log**  

### Real-Time Detection

```
T0: User clicks "Play" on blocked game in app
    ‚îî‚îÄ Game ID: 93978595733734

T1: Roblox creates/updates player log file
    ‚îî‚îÄ Contains: "place 93978595733734"

T2: Our LogMonitor reads new log lines
    ‚îî‚îÄ Detects pattern match

T3: LogMonitor extracts placeId = 93978595733734
    ‚îî‚îÄ Checks blocklist

T4: Found in blocklist - BLOCK!
    ‚îî‚îÄ Terminates RobloxPlayerBeta process
    ‚îî‚îÄ Shows Block UI

Result: Game BLOCKED ‚úÖ
```

---

## How It Works

### Log Location

```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Roblox\logs\
```

Files match pattern: `0.695.0.6950957_20251020T043932Z_Player_XXXXX_last.log`

### File Format

CSV with timestamp-prefixed log entries:

```
2025-10-20T04:39:40.248Z,8.248455,3d38,10 [DFLog::KeyRing] ...
2025-10-20T04:39:40.252Z,8.252423,3d38,6 [FLog::Output] ! Joining game 'cfbd5c4e-7709-4306-b1b0-7fee671d7792' place 93978595733734 at 10.18.9.6
2025-10-20T04:39:40.252Z,8.252423,3d38,6 [FLog::GameJoinLoadTime] Report game_join_loadtime: placeid:93978595733734, ...
```

### Regex Pattern

```regex
! Joining game '[^']+' place (\d+) at
```

Captures the placeId in group 1.

### Monitoring Algorithm

```csharp
1. Find most recent player log file in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\logs\
2. Open file and seek to last read position
3. Read new lines until EOF
4. For each line, test against regex
5. If pattern matches:
   a. Extract placeId from capture group
   b. Load RobloxGuard config
   c. Check if placeId in blocklist
   d. If blocked:
      - Terminate RobloxPlayerBeta.exe
      - Show Block UI
   e. If allowed:
      - Continue (do nothing)
6. Update position, wait 500ms, repeat
```

## Solution Architecture

### Three Blocking Mechanisms (After This)

| Mechanism | Trigger | Method | Admin? | Latency |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Protocol Handler** | Website click | Registry URI interception | ‚ùå NO | Immediate |
| **Log Monitor** | App launch | Log file tail monitoring | ‚ùå NO | ~500ms |
| **Handler Lock** | Roblox hijack | Registry watchdog | ‚ùå NO | ~5s |

### All Three Work Together

```
Website Click ‚Üí Protocol Handler ‚Üí BLOCKED ‚úÖ
App Launch ‚Üí Log Monitor ‚Üí BLOCKED ‚úÖ
Roblox Hijacks Registry ‚Üí Handler Lock ‚Üí Restores Control ‚úÖ
```

---

## Implementation: LogMonitor.cs

### Key Features

1. **Real-time monitoring** - Checks log every 500ms
2. **Automatic log rotation** - Detects new log files automatically
3. **Efficient file reading** - Tracks position, only reads new content
4. **Immediate blocking** - Terminates RobloxPlayerBeta on detection
5. **No admin required** - User-accessible log files

### Usage

```csharp
// Create monitor
var monitor = new LogMonitor(onGameDetected: (evt) =>
{
    if (evt.IsBlocked)
        Console.WriteLine($"Blocked game {evt.PlaceId}");
    else
        Console.WriteLine($"Allowed game {evt.PlaceId}");
});

// Start monitoring
monitor.Start();

// ... user plays games ...

// Stop when done
monitor.Stop();
```

### Integration Points

1. **Program.cs** - Add `--monitor-logs` command
2. **ProcessWatcher.cs** - Could use log monitor as fallback to WMI
3. **Settings UI** - Toggle "Monitor player logs"
4. **Scheduled Task** - Could run log monitor instead of process watcher

---

## Why This Beats Previous Approaches

### vs. WMI Process Monitoring ‚úÖ BETTER
- ‚úÖ No permission errors
- ‚úÖ Extracts placeId (WMI needs command line parsing)
- ‚úÖ Faster detection (logs written before process runs)
- ‚úÖ Works even if RobloxPlayerBeta doesn't expose command line

### vs. Registry Monitoring ‚úÖ SIMPLER
- ‚úÖ Roblox doesn't lock log files
- ‚úÖ Clear, explicit placeId format
- ‚úÖ Less fragile than registry hooks
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug (just read text file)

### vs. Handler Lock Alone ‚úÖ COMPLEMENTARY
- ‚úÖ Handles app launches
- ‚úÖ Works even if handler hijacking succeeds temporarily
- ‚úÖ Independent verification method

## Testing the Log Monitor

### Test Setup

```powershell
# Start the monitor
RobloxGuard.exe --monitor-logs

# You'll see:
# [LogMonitor] Started monitoring: 0.694.0.6940982_20251020T043932Z_Player_XXXXX_last.log
# (waiting for game joins...)
```

### Test Case 1: Launch Blocked Game

1. Start log monitor
2. Click "Play" on game 93978595733734 from Roblox app
3. Expected output:
   ```
   [LogMonitor] Detected game join: placeId=93978595733734
   [LogMonitor] Game 93978595733734 is BLOCKED
   [LogMonitor] Terminating RobloxPlayerBeta (PID: 1234)
   ```
4. Game should close immediately ‚úÖ

### Test Case 2: Launch Allowed Game

1. Start log monitor
2. Click "Play" on game 2 (allowed) from Roblox app
3. Expected output:
   ```
   [LogMonitor] Detected game join: placeId=2
   [LogMonitor] Game 2 is allowed
   ```
4. Game should launch normally ‚úÖ

## Deployment Strategy

### Immediate (v1.0.2)

1. **Add LogMonitor.cs** to RobloxGuard.Core
2. **Add --monitor-logs command** to Program.cs
3. **Update --install-first-run** to create log monitor task
4. **Update Settings UI** with "Monitor Player Logs" toggle

### Code Changes

**Program.cs:**
```csharp
case "--monitor-logs":
    MonitorPlayerLogs();
    break;

static void MonitorPlayerLogs()
{
    Console.WriteLine("=== Log Monitor Mode ===");
    Console.WriteLine("Monitoring Roblox player logs for game joins...");
    Console.WriteLine("Press Ctrl+C to stop");
    
    using (var monitor = new LogMonitor(OnGameDetected))
    {
        monitor.Start();
        try
        {
            while (true) Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Log monitor stopped.");
        }
    }
}

static void OnGameDetected(LogBlockEvent evt)
{
    var timestamp = evt.Timestamp.ToString("HH:mm:ss");
    if (evt.IsBlocked)
        Console.WriteLine($"[{timestamp}] ‚ùå BLOCKED: Game {evt.PlaceId}");
    else
        Console.WriteLine($"[{timestamp}] ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Game {evt.PlaceId}");
}
```

### Scheduled Task Update

Instead of WMI watcher, run log monitor:
```
RobloxGuard.exe --monitor-logs
```

---

## Edge Cases & Solutions

### Edge Case 1: Multiple Log Files
**Problem:** User plays multiple games, log files rotate  
**Solution:** Monitor finds newest `*_Player_*_last.log` file automatically

### Edge Case 2: Log File Already Exists
**Problem:** Monitor starts mid-session, reads old entries  
**Solution:** Track file position; only read new content since startup

### Edge Case 3: Log File Deleted
**Problem:** Roblox cleans up old logs  
**Solution:** Monitor detects new file, resets position to 0

### Edge Case 4: Multiple Log Entries Per Second
**Problem:** Fast game switching  
**Solution:** Each entry checked independently; latest placeId wins

### Edge Case 5: Process Already Terminated
**Problem:** Kill process that's already dying  
**Solution:** Silently ignore errors; process may be closing anyway

## Performance Considerations

### File I/O
- Polling every 500ms
- Only reads new content (seeks to last position)
- Minimal overhead

### Memory
- Single StreamReader active
- Regex compiled for performance
- ~1MB RAM overhead

### CPU
- ~0.1% CPU when idle (just sleeping)
- ~0.5% CPU when reading logs

### Scalability
- Handles any number of games
- Scales linearly with log file size
- No database needed

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Still Works
- ‚úÖ Protocol handler (website clicks)
- ‚úÖ Process watcher via WMI (if admin)
- ‚úÖ Handler lock (registry protection)
- ‚úÖ Block UI (unified interface)

### New Addition
- üÜï Log monitor (app launches, no admin)

### Migration Path
1. v1.0.1 - Current (protocol handler works)
2. v1.0.2 - Add log monitor (app launches work)
3. v1.0.3 - Integrate all three methods
4. Future - Automatic method selection based on environment

- [ ] Add `docs/log_monitor.md`
- [ ] Update `docs/architecture.md`
- [ ] Update README with "App Launch Blocking" section
