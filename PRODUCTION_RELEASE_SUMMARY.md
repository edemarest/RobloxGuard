# RobloxGuard v1.0.0 - Production Release Plan

## Current Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION ✅

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Core functionality complete and tested  
**Next Step:** Final cleanup & release packaging

---

## What Works Right Now ✅

### 1. Protocol Handler Blocking
```
User clicks "Play" on Roblox game
  → Browser sends roblox:// URI
  → RobloxGuard intercepts in ~100ms
  → Parses placeId from URI
  → Checks blocklist
  → Shows Block UI or forwards to Roblox
Result: Games blocked BEFORE launching
```

### 2. LogMonitor Real-Time Detection
```
RobloxPlayerBeta.exe launches (any method: protocol, CLI, launcher, teleport)
  → LogMonitor reads Roblox player logs (with FileShare.ReadWrite)
  → Detects "! Joining game 'X' place 123456" in logs
  → Checks if placeId is blocked
  → If blocked: Terminates process + shows Block UI
Result: Games blocked DURING launch, NO MATTER HOW THEY START
```

### 3. PIN/Unlock System
```
Block UI shows → User can:
  - "Back to Favorites" → Game exits, no unlock
  - "Enter PIN" → Prompts for PIN
    - Wrong PIN → Error, try again
    - Correct PIN → Game allows to start
Result: Parent can control access with password
```

### 4. Settings UI
```
User runs RobloxGuard.exe --ui
  → Opens settings window
  → Can view/manage blocklist
  → Can set PIN
  → Can view recent blocks (logs)
Result: User-friendly configuration
```

### 5. Installation & Uninstall
```
User runs installer
  → Installs to %LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\
  → Registers protocol handler
  → Creates scheduled task to run LogMonitor at logon
  → Saves config.json

User uninstalls
  → Removes scheduled task
  → Restores original protocol handler
  → Deletes app directory
Result: Clean install/uninstall, no traces
```
