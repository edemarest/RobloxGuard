# GitHub Actions CI/CD - Complete Setup Verification

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY CONFIGURED AND READY**

---

## 📋 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

### Workflow 1: Build & Test (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers**:
- ✅ Every push to `main` branch
- ✅ Every pull request to `main`
- ✅ Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

**Runs on**: Windows Latest (GitHub-hosted runner)

**What it does**:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup .NET 8.0 SDK
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Build Release configuration
5. Run all 36 unit tests
6. Publish single-file, self-contained EXE
7. Build installer with Inno Setup
8. Generate SHA256 checksums
9. Upload artifacts

**Expected duration**: ~5-10 minutes

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ All 36 tests pass
- ✅ EXE generated (~100MB)
- ✅ Installer created
- ✅ Checksums generated

---

### Workflow 2: Release (`/.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Triggers**:
- ✅ When a tag matching `v*` is pushed (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

**What it does**:
1. Runs CI workflow
2. Downloads artifacts
3. Creates GitHub Release
4. Attaches artifacts to release

**Expected duration**: ~10-15 minutes

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ GitHub Release created
- ✅ EXE, installer, and checksums attached
- ✅ Release notes generated

## 🔧 CI/CD Configuration Details

### Build Step
```yaml
- name: Build
  run: dotnet build ./src/RobloxGuard.sln -c Release --no-restore
```
✅ Will build: Core, Tests, UI, Installers

### Test Step
```yaml
- name: Test
  run: dotnet test ./src/RobloxGuard.sln -c Release --no-build --verbosity normal
```
✅ Will run: 36 unit tests (all passing)

### Publish Step
```yaml
- name: Publish (single-file, self-contained)
  run: dotnet publish ./src/RobloxGuard.UI/RobloxGuard.UI.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:SelfContained=true -o out\publish
```
✅ Creates standalone `RobloxGuard.exe` (~100MB, no .NET required)

### Installer Step
```yaml
- name: Install Inno Setup
  run: choco install innosetup --yes

- name: Build installer (Inno)
  run: '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" .\build\inno\RobloxGuard.iss'
```
✅ Creates `RobloxGuard-Setup.exe` installer

### Checksums Step
```yaml
- name: Checksums
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    Get-ChildItem out\publish, build\inno\Output -Recurse | `
      Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 | `
      ForEach-Object { "$($_.Hash)  $($_.Path)" } | `
      Set-Content out\checksums.sha256
```
✅ Generates SHA256 hashes for verification

---

## 📦 Artifacts Generated

After successful CI run, the following artifacts are created:

```
RobloxGuard-artifacts/
├── publish/
│   ├── RobloxGuard.exe                 ← Single-file executable
│   ├── *.dll                           ← Runtime dependencies
│   └── ... (other runtime files)
├── inno/Output/
│   └── RobloxGuard-Setup.exe           ← Installer
└── checksums.sha256                    ← SHA256 hashes
```

**Artifact retention**: 90 days (default GitHub retention)

## 🚀 How to Trigger Release

### Option 1: Automatic (Tag-based)
```powershell
# In your local repo
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Runs CI workflow (build + test)
# 2. Creates GitHub Release
# 3. Uploads all artifacts
# 4. Release is live!
```

### Option 2: Manual (Workflow Dispatch)
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Select "Build & Package RobloxGuard"
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Artifacts will be generated

## 🧪 Testing GitHub Actions Locally

You can test the workflow without pushing to GitHub using `act`:

```powershell
# Install act (GitHub Actions runner)
choco install act-cli

# Run the CI workflow locally
act push -j build

# Run the release workflow
act push -e event.json -j publish
```

---

## 📝 Troubleshooting GitHub Actions

### If build fails:

**Check**:
1. All tests still passing: `dotnet test src\RobloxGuard.sln`
2. Release build works locally: `dotnet build src\RobloxGuard.sln -c Release`
3. Inno Setup script is valid: `build/inno/RobloxGuard.iss` exists

**Common issues**:
- ❌ NuGet package not restored
  - Solution: Run `dotnet restore` before build
- ❌ Inno Setup not installed
  - Solution: Already handled by workflow (`choco install innosetup`)
- ❌ Tests failing
  - Solution: Run tests locally to debug

### If release workflow fails:

**Check**:
1. CI workflow completed successfully
2. Git tag is correct format (`v*`)
3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available (default for GitHub Actions)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided (no setup needed)
- ✅ No API keys or secrets stored in workflow
- ✅ No credentials in repository

### Workflow Security
- ✅ Uses official GitHub actions (checkout, setup-dotnet, etc.)
- ✅ Third-party action (softprops/action-gh-release) is well-maintained
- ✅ No arbitrary script execution

### Release Signing (Future Enhancement)
Consider adding code signing for production release:
```yaml
- name: Sign executable
  uses: microsoft/azure-code-signing-action@v0.1
  with:
    azure-key-vault-url: ${{ secrets.AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URL }}
    # ... other parameters
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring Workflow Performance

### View workflow runs:
1. Go to GitHub repo
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Select workflow
4. View run history with logs

### Track metrics:
- Build time (~2-3 min)
- Test execution (~5 sec)
- Artifact size (~100MB EXE + installer)
- Workflow success rate

---

```

### Step 2: Commit and Push
```powershell
