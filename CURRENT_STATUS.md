## What This Means

**You have NOT started testing LogMonitor yet.** The system is ready, but needs:
1. LogMonitor to be manually started in a terminal
2. Roblox app to be launched
3. User to click "Play" on a blocked game

---

## To Test Now (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start LogMonitor
```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RobloxGuard\RobloxGuard.exe" --monitor-logs
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== Log Monitor Mode ===
Monitoring Roblox player logs for game joins...
Log directory: C:\Users\ellaj\AppData\Local\Roblox\logs
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

‚è≥ **KEEP THIS TERMINAL OPEN**

### Step 2: Open Roblox App
```powershell
Start-Process roblox.exe
```

Wait 30 seconds for app to load

### Step 3: Click Play on Blocked Game
In Roblox app:
- Search for game ID: **1818**
- Click **PLAY**

### Step 4: Watch Terminal
Expected in LogMonitor terminal:
```
[HH:MM:SS] ‚ùå BLOCKED: Game 1818
```

Expected in Roblox:
- Game doesn't launch (closes immediately)

---

## What Happens Automatically

1. **You click Play** ‚Üí Roblox writes to log file
2. **LogMonitor detects** (within 500ms) ‚Üí Reads log entry: `! Joining game 'UUID' place 1818 at <IP>`
3. **LogMonitor checks** ‚Üí Is 1818 in blocklist? YES
4. **LogMonitor blocks** ‚Üí Finds and terminates RobloxPlayerBeta process
5. **LogMonitor reports** ‚Üí Prints `‚ùå BLOCKED: Game 1818` to terminal
