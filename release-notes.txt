## v1.2.0 - Comprehensive Debug Logging

### What's New
- **Detailed logging for troubleshooting**: All game detection, blocking, and process termination events are now logged to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\launcher.log`
- **Monitor crash diagnostics**: Complete stack traces and error information are captured, making it easy to debug why the monitor might stop unexpectedly
- **Robust AlertWindow handling**: If the alert window fails to display, a fallback MessageBox appears with diagnostic information
- **Enhanced file logging**: All WinExe operations are logged to file since console output is not visible in Windows GUI apps

### Why This Matters
Previously, when the monitor stopped after detecting a blocked game, there was no way to know what went wrong. Now you can check the debug log to see:
- Whether the game was detected (`DETECTED GAME JOIN`)
- Whether it was marked as blocked (`IS BLOCKED`)
- Whether the process was terminated successfully
- Any errors that occurred (including full stack traces)

### Testing Instructions
1. Download `RobloxGuard.exe` from this release
2. Run it to install (first run auto-starts the monitor)
3. Try to join a blocked game
4. Check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\launcher.log` for detailed diagnostics
5. Report any issues with the log contents
