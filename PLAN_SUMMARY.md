## 📊 The Refactor at a Glance

### What We're Removing ❌

| Item | Lines | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| **PlaytimeTracker.cs** | 656 | All scheduling logic unnecessary |
| **Config: Playtime settings** | ~30 | No more time-based enforcement |
| **Config: After-hours settings** | ~30 | No more bedtime enforcement |
| **Config: Random delays** | ~20 | No more schedule unpredictability |
| **LogMonitor: Playtime polling** | ~25 | No more per-iteration checks |
| **PlaytimeTrackerTests.cs** | 200 | Tests for deleted component |
| **DayCounterManager (partial)** | ~50 | Scheduling-specific utilities |
| **Total Removal** | **~1,011 lines** | ✅ Huge simplification |

### What We're Keeping ✅

| Component | Why | Impact |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Game Detection** | Still need to know when user joins blocked game | Zero changes |
| **Session Management** | Still need to track "is user in blocked game?" | Zero changes |
| **Graceful Kill/Restart** | Still need elegant game termination | Zero changes |
| **Watchdog Monitoring** | Still need durable monitoring | Zero changes |
| **Heartbeat/Health** | Still need crash recovery | Zero changes |
| **Alert UI** | Still show block notification | Zero changes |
| **Log Monitoring** | Still tail Roblox logs for game detection | Core loop simplified |

### What We're Adding ✨

| Item | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **DiscordNotificationListener.cs** | 300 | Listen to Discord notifications |
| **Discord config settings** | 4 | User ID, trigger keyword, enabled flag |
| **Event handler in LogMonitor** | 15 | Connect Discord events to kill logic |
| **Total Addition** | **~319 lines** | Event-driven trigger |

### Net Result

```
-1,011 lines (removed)
+  319 lines (added)
────────────
- 692 lines (NET REDUCTION) ✅

Codebase is 12% simpler!
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Comparison

### Current (Schedule-Based) - COMPLEX ❌

```
LogMonitor Main Loop (Every 100ms)
├─ Read Roblox logs
├─ Detect game join
├─ PlaytimeTracker:
│  ├─ Calculate elapsed time
│  ├─ Apply random delay
│  ├─ Check if threshold reached
│  ├─ Calculate after-hours window
│  ├─ Check if in enforcement window
│  └─ Execute kill if conditions met
├─ Check for stale sessions
├─ Update heartbeat
└─ Sleep 100ms

Result: Complex branching, many edge cases, hard to debug
```

### New (Event-Driven) - SIMPLE ✅

```
Startup
├─ Initialize DiscordNotificationListener
└─ Subscribe to TriggerReceived event

Main Loop (Every 100ms) - MUCH SIMPLER
├─ Read Roblox logs
├─ Detect game join
├─ Save session "is user in blocked game?"
├─ Check for game exit
├─ Update heartbeat
└─ Sleep 100ms

Discord Event Handler - FIRES ON DEMAND
└─ On notification:
   ├─ Check if user in blocked game
   ├─ If yes: Kill immediately
   └─ If no: Ignore

Result: Simple, predictable, easy to understand
```

## 📋 Execution Plan - 3 Phases

### Phase 1: Code Removal (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Delete all scheduling logic, get codebase compiling without PlaytimeTracker

```
Step 1: Remove config settings (30 settings)
        └─ Open RobloxGuardConfig.cs
        └─ Delete 9 playtime/after-hours properties
        └─ Add 4 Discord properties

Step 2: Remove from LogMonitor (initialization)
        └─ Delete _playtimeTracker field
        └─ Delete initialization code
        
Step 3: Remove from LogMonitor (main loop)
        └─ Delete playtime checking code
        └─ Delete after-hours checking code
        
Step 4: Delete entire files
        └─ Delete PlaytimeTracker.cs (656 lines)
        └─ Delete PlaytimeTrackerTests.cs (200 lines)
        
Step 5: Compile & fix errors
        └─ dotnet build
        └─ Resolve any remaining references

Step 6: Run tests
        └─ dotnet test
        └─ Expect: most pass, PlaytimeTrackerTests gone
```

**Success:** Code compiles, game detection still works, no scheduling code

---

### Phase 2: Discord Integration (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Add Discord notification listener, wire up to LogMonitor

```
Step 1: Create DiscordNotificationListener.cs
        ├─ Windows Notification Handler subscription
        ├─ Discord notification parsing
        ├─ User ID matching
        ├─ Keyword filtering
        └─ Event emission

Step 2: Update LogMonitor startup
        ├─ Initialize Discord listener
        ├─ Subscribe to notification events
        └─ Add event handler (check session → kill if blocked)

Step 3: Update Program.cs
        └─ Update CLI help/validation for Discord config

Step 4: Run tests
        └─ dotnet test
        └─ All tests should pass

Step 5: Create Discord tests
        ├─ DiscordNotificationListenerTests.cs
        ├─ Test notification parsing
        ├─ Test user ID filtering
        └─ Test keyword matching
```

**Success:** Discord listener works, notification events fire, kills execute

---

### Phase 3: Manual Testing (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Verify end-to-end system works correctly

```
Test 1: Game Detection (No Discord)
  ├─ Start monitor
  ├─ Join blocked game
  ├─ Verify: Session saved, log shows join
  ├─ Exit game
  └─ Verify: Session cleared

Test 2: Discord Notification Trigger
  ├─ Start monitor (Discord enabled)
  ├─ Join blocked game
  ├─ Send Discord message from target user
  ├─ Verify: Notification parsed
  ├─ Verify: Game killed
  ├─ Verify: Alert shown
  └─ Verify: Restarted to home

Test 3: Wrong User ID (Should NOT trigger)
  ├─ Join blocked game
  ├─ Send Discord message from DIFFERENT user
  └─ Verify: Game NOT killed

Test 4: Wrong Keyword (Should NOT trigger)
  ├─ Join blocked game
  ├─ Send Discord message without keyword
  └─ Verify: Game NOT killed

Test 5: No Active Game (Should NOT kill)
  ├─ Exit game (or start with no game)
  ├─ Send Discord message
  └─ Verify: No error, notification ignored

Test 6: Multiple Notifications (Should be idempotent)
  ├─ Join blocked game
  ├─ Send 3 Discord messages quickly
  └─ Verify: Game killed once, no errors
```

**Success:** All tests pass, system is reliable
