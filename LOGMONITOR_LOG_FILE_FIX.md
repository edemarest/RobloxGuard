# LogMonitor Log File Detection Fix - October 20, 2025

## Problem Identified ⚠️

**LogMonitor was looking at the WRONG log file!**

When you join a game in Roblox, it creates a **BRAND NEW log file** with a different timestamp. Example:
- Old log: `0.694.0.6940982_20251020T043932Z_Player_ABC123_last.log`
- New log: `0.694.0.6940982_20251020T055541Z_Player_DEF456_last.log`

**What was happening:**
1. LogMonitor started, found the latest log file ✅
2. You launched Roblox, it created a NEW log file (with new timestamp)
3. LogMonitor was still reading the OLD file ❌
4. The "! Joining game" message was in the NEW file
5. LogMonitor never saw it because it was looking at the wrong file!

## Debug Evidence

**You found the join message!**
```
! Joining game 'fc6b3be3-6bce-4423-8e3d-1aae6f793a8c' place 93978595733734 at 10.221.34.23
```

This was in the newest log file: `0.694.0.6940982_20251020T045541Z_Player_7E235_last.log`

But LogMonitor was still reading an older file because:
- GetCurrentLogFile() only ran periodically (every 100ms)
- It wasn't parsing the filename timestamp correctly
- It was relying on LastWriteTime which lags

## Solution Implemented ✅

Updated `GetCurrentLogFile()` to:

1. **Parse the filename timestamp** (`_20251020T055541Z_`)
2. **Sort by the ACTUAL timestamp in the filename** (most reliable)
3. **Fallback to LastWriteTime** if parsing fails
4. **Always find the truly newest log file**

```csharp
// Extract timestamp from filename: 0.694.0.6940982_20251020T043932Z_Player_*.log
// Parse: 20251020T043932Z
// This is more reliable than LastWriteTime!
var match = Regex.Match(f, @"_(\d{8}T\d{6}Z)_");
if (match.Success && DateTime.TryParseExact(match.Groups[1].Value, "yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ", ...))
{
    return dt; // Sort by this
}
```

## How It Works Now

```
Timeline of Game Launch:
├─ T=0ms: Roblox creates NEW log file (20251020T055541Z)
├─ T=50ms: User clicks "Play" on game 1818
├─ T=100ms: LogMonitor runs GetCurrentLogFile()
│         ├─ Finds OLD file: 20251020T054532Z (example)
│         ├─ Finds NEW file: 20251020T055541Z ← LATEST!
│         └─ Switches to NEW file (because timestamp is newer)
├─ T=150ms: Roblox writes: "! Joining game 'UUID' place 1818 at X.X.X.X"
├─ T=200ms: LogMonitor polls every 100ms
├─ T=200ms: Finds join message in NEW file ← DETECTS IMMEDIATELY!
├─ T=200ms: Checks blocklist ← BLOCKED!
├─ T=200ms: Kills RobloxPlayerBeta ← PROCESS TERMINATED!
└─ T=250ms: Terminal: "❌ BLOCKED: Game 1818"
```

## Files Modified

```
src/RobloxGuard.Core/LogMonitor.cs
- Lines 71-103: Rewrote GetCurrentLogFile()
  • Now parses filename timestamp (yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ)
  • Sorts by actual timestamp (not just LastWriteTime)
  • Improved error handling with debug logging
  • Fallback to LastWriteTime if parsing fails
```

## What Changed

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Log File Detection** | LastWriteTime only | Filename timestamp + fallback |
| **Timestamp Parsing** | None | Regex + DateTime parse |
| **Accuracy** | ❌ Could miss new files | ✅ Always finds newest |
| **Response Time** | 500ms delay | 100ms delay |
| **Process Kill** | Graceful close | Aggressive force kill |

## Testing Now

The updated monitor is running with:
- ✅ 100ms polling
- ✅ Aggressive process kill
- ✅ **NEW:** Filename timestamp parsing for correct log file detection
- ✅ Same blocklist checking

**Try it now!**
1. **Open Roblox app**
2. **Click Play on blocked game (1818 or 93978595733734)**
3. **Expected:** Game IMMEDIATELY closes (before you see game world)
4. **Terminal:** `❌ BLOCKED: Game XXXX` (within ~100ms)

The key difference: **LogMonitor will now be reading the correct log file!**
