## 🔍 Monitor the Release

### Live Monitoring Options

**Option 1: GitHub Actions Page**
```
https://github.com/edemarest/RobloxGuard/actions
```
- Shows real-time workflow progress
- Watch "Release" workflow run
- See which step is executing

**Option 2: GitHub Releases Page**
```
https://github.com/edemarest/RobloxGuard/releases
```
- Shows when release is created
- Click to see artifacts
- Download from here

**Option 3: Local Check (Every 1-2 minutes)**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\ellaj\Desktop\RobloxGuard

# Check if release was created
Invoke-WebRequest https://api.github.com/repos/edemarest/RobloxGuard/releases/latest -UseBasicParsing | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object tag_name, created_at
```

---

## 📥 Step 7: Download Release Artifacts

### When Release is Ready (in ~5-10 minutes)

**Go to**: https://github.com/edemarest/RobloxGuard/releases/tag/v1.0.0

**Download these 3 files**:
```
1. RobloxGuard.exe
   - Main executable (single-file, self-contained)
   - Size: ~100MB
   
2. RobloxGuardInstaller.exe
   - Installer (creates shortcuts, auto-start task)
   - Size: ~50MB
   
3. checksums.sha256
   - SHA256 hashes for verification
   - Verify downloads aren't corrupted
```

### Verify Checksums

```powershell
# Navigate to where you downloaded the files
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads

# Verify checksums
Get-FileHash RobloxGuard.exe -Algorithm SHA256 | Format-List
Get-FileHash RobloxGuardInstaller.exe -Algorithm SHA256 | Format-List

# Compare against checksums.sha256 file
# (Should match exactly)
```

## 🧪 Step 8: Real-World Testing (9 Scenarios)

Once you have the release EXE + Installer, follow the 9 test scenarios from `REAL_WORLD_TESTING_PROCEDURES.md`:

### Quick Test Overview

```
Test 1: Installation
  ├─ Run RobloxGuardInstaller.exe
  ├─ Set parent PIN (e.g., 1234)
  └─ Verify installed to %LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\

Test 2: Configuration
  ├─ Launch Settings UI
  ├─ Add blocked game (Adopt Me! - placeId: 920587237)
  └─ Save configuration

Test 3: Allowed Game
  ├─ Launch unblocked game
  ├─ Verify: Roblox launches normally
  └─ No block window

Test 4: Blocked Game (Protocol Handler)
  ├─ Click blocked game link in browser
  ├─ Verify: Block window appears instantly
  ├─ Enter parent PIN: 1234
  └─ Verify: Game unlocks and launches

Test 5: Blocked Game (Roblox Player App)
  ├─ Use Roblox Player desktop app
  ├─ Click blocked game
  ├─ Verify: Block window appears
  └─ Cannot bypass

Test 6: Process Watcher
  ├─ Try direct launch: RobloxPlayerBeta.exe --id 920587237
  ├─ Verify: Block window appears
  └─ Process terminated

Test 7: Auto-Start
  ├─ Reboot computer
  ├─ Verify: Scheduled task runs (watcher starts)
  ├─ Check: Watcher logs to %LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\logs\
  └─ Process running in background

Test 8: Uninstall
  ├─ Uninstall via Control Panel
  ├─ Verify: All files deleted
  ├─ Verify: Registry cleaned
  ├─ Verify: Original Roblox handler restored
  └─ No artifacts left

Test 9: Edge Cases
  ├─ Try invalid PINs (verify rejection)
  ├─ Try to delete config.json (verify app handles)
  ├─ Try to modify blocklist JSON (verify it's read)
  └─ Try multiple blocked game launches
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Monitor Without Opening Browser
```powershell
# Check release status via PowerShell
$release = Invoke-WebRequest https://api.github.com/repos/edemarest/RobloxGuard/releases/latest -UseBasicParsing | ConvertFrom-Json

Write-Host "Release: $($release.tag_name)"
Write-Host "Created: $($release.created_at)"
Write-Host "Assets: $($release.assets.Count)"
$release.assets | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "  - $($_.name)" }
```

### Download via PowerShell
```powershell
# Get latest release download URL
$release = Invoke-WebRequest https://api.github.com/repos/edemarest/RobloxGuard/releases/latest -UseBasicParsing | ConvertFrom-Json

# Download each asset
$release.assets | ForEach-Object {
  $url = $_.browser_download_url
  $filename = $_.name
  Invoke-WebRequest $url -OutFile "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\$filename"
  Write-Host "Downloaded: $filename"
}
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Release Not Appearing After 15 Minutes?

1. **Check Actions Page**
   ```
   https://github.com/edemarest/RobloxGuard/actions
   ```
   Look for "Release" workflow - is it red (failed)?

2. **Check Workflow Logs**
   - Click the failed workflow
   - Scroll to see error message
   - Note the error

3. **Common Issues**
   - Network timeout (wait and retry)
   - Missing file (shouldn't happen - audited)
   - GitHub API limit (unlikely)

### Files Downloaded But Checksums Don't Match?

```powershell
# Verify checksums manually
$downloadedFile = "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\RobloxGuard.exe"
$hash = (Get-FileHash $downloadedFile -Algorithm SHA256).Hash

# Compare with checksums.sha256 file
# Example: checksums.sha256 might contain:
# ABC123DEF456...  RobloxGuard.exe

if ($hash -eq "ABC123DEF456...") {
  Write-Host "✅ Checksum valid!"
} else {
  Write-Host "❌ Checksum mismatch - redownload file"
}
```
