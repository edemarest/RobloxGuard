## üß™ Pre-Release Testing Procedure

### Phase 1: Local Manual Testing

#### 1.1 Protocol Handler Interception
```powershell
# Simulate Roblox protocol URI
Start-Process "roblox-player://placeId=12345"
```
**Expected**: Block UI appears (if 12345 is in blocklist)

#### 1.2 Process Watcher
```powershell
# Start watcher in background
Start-Process "RobloxGuard.exe" -ArgumentList "--watch" -NoNewWindow -PassThru

# Simulate process spawn (requires RobloxPlayerBeta.exe available)
# Should trigger block if placeId in blocklist
```
**Expected**: Block UI appears when RobloxPlayerBeta.exe spawns with blocked placeId

#### 1.3 Installation Flow
```powershell
# First-run setup
RobloxGuard.exe --install-first-run

# Verify registry
Get-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\Software\Classes\roblox-player\shell\open\command'
# Should show: RobloxGuard.exe --handle-uri "%1"

# Verify scheduled task
schtasks /query /tn RobloxGuard\Watcher

# Verify config
ls "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RobloxGuard\"
```
**Expected**: All three items created successfully

#### 1.4 Uninstall Flow
```powershell
# Uninstall
RobloxGuard.exe --uninstall

# Verify original handler restored
Get-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\Software\Classes\roblox-player\shell\open\command'

# Verify task deleted
schtasks /query /tn RobloxGuard\Watcher
# Should show: ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified
```
**Expected**: Original state restored, RobloxGuard removed

#### 1.5 Settings UI
```powershell
RobloxGuard.exe --ui
```
**Expected**:
- [ ] Settings window opens
- [ ] PIN tab: Can set/change PIN
- [ ] Blocklist tab: Can add/remove games
- [ ] Settings tab: Toggles work
- [ ] About tab: Shows info

---

### Phase 2: Real Roblox Client Testing

**Environment**: Windows VM (clean or with Roblox installed)

#### 2.1 Pre-Test Setup
1. [ ] Install latest Roblox client
2. [ ] Run: `RobloxGuard.exe --install-first-run`
3. [ ] Run: `RobloxGuard.exe --ui`
4. [ ] Set PIN (e.g., "1234")
5. [ ] Add a game to blocklist (find a placeId)

#### 2.2 Test: Allowed Game Launch
```
1. [ ] Click "Play" on a game NOT in blocklist
2. [ ] Verify Roblox launches normally
3. [ ] Expected: No Block UI appears
```

#### 2.3 Test: Blocked Game - Protocol Handler
```
1. [ ] Click "Play" on a game IN blocklist
2. [ ] Expected: Block UI appears immediately
3. [ ] Verify message shows: "Place [ID] is blocked"
4. [ ] Click "Back to Favorites" ‚Üí Window closes, no launch
5. [ ] Try again with wrong PIN ‚Üí Error message
6. [ ] Try again with correct PIN ‚Üí Game launches
```

#### 2.4 Test: Blocked Game - Process Watcher
```
1. [ ] Start watcher: RobloxGuard.exe --watch
2. [ ] Try launching blocked game via Roblox client
3. [ ] Expected: Block UI appears (if protocol handler didn't catch it)
4. [ ] Verify process terminated (RobloxPlayerBeta.exe gone)
```

#### 2.5 Test: Auto-Start on Logon
```
1. [ ] Restart Windows
2. [ ] Verify scheduled task ran (process running in background)
3. [ ] Try launching blocked game ‚Üí Block UI appears
```

#### 2.6 Test: Uninstall Cleanup
```
1. [ ] Run: RobloxGuard.exe --uninstall
2. [ ] Launch blocked game ‚Üí Should work (no blocking)
3. [ ] Verify scheduled task gone
4. [ ] Verify registry restored to original Roblox handler
5. [ ] Verify %LOCALAPPDATA%\RobloxGuard\ cleaned up (or contains only config)
```

---

### Phase 3: Installer Testing

#### 3.1 Build Installer
```powershell
# Run GitHub Actions locally or:
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:SelfContained=true `
  src/RobloxGuard.UI

# Create installer (requires Inno Setup installed)
choco install innosetup
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" .\build\inno\RobloxGuard.iss

# Output: build/inno/Output/RobloxGuard-Setup.exe
```

#### 3.2 Test Installer on Clean VM
```
1. [ ] Fresh Windows VM (no RobloxGuard, no .NET)
2. [ ] Run RobloxGuard-Setup.exe
3. [ ] Expected: Prompts for install location, then installs
4. [ ] Expected: Registry changed, task created, config initialized
5. [ ] Expected: Can run RobloxGuard.exe --ui after install
6. [ ] Expected: Roblox blocking works
```

#### 3.3 Test Uninstaller
```
1. [ ] Run installer again or: Control Panel ‚Üí Programs ‚Üí Uninstall
2. [ ] Expected: All registry entries removed
3. [ ] Expected: Scheduled task deleted
4. [ ] Expected: App folder deleted (or config kept)
5. [ ] Expected: Roblox works normally again (no blocking)
```
