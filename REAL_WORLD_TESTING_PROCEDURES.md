# RobloxGuard - Real-World Testing Before Release

**Status**: Ready for Real-World Testing  
**Next Step**: Manual validation with actual Roblox client  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  

---

## üéØ Testing Objectives

Before releasing to production, we need to verify:

1. ‚úÖ Protocol handler **actually intercepts** Roblox URIs
2. ‚úÖ Block UI **appears correctly** when game is blocked
3. ‚úÖ PIN **prevents unauthorized** game launch
4. ‚úÖ Process watcher **detects and terminates** blocked processes
5. ‚úÖ Registry changes **persist correctly**
6. ‚úÖ Uninstall **completely removes** all traces
7. ‚úÖ Installer **works on clean VM** (no .NET pre-installed)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Test Environment Setup

### Recommended: Virtual Machine

**Why VM?**
- Isolate testing from main system
- Can revert to clean state
- Can test installer on fresh Windows
- Safe to test edge cases

**VM Specifications**:
- OS: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- Disk: 40GB
- RAM: 4GB minimum
- Network: Internet connection (for Roblox and .NET)

**Setup Steps**:
1. Create VM snapshot "Clean Install"
2. Install Roblox client
3. Create snapshot "With Roblox"
4. Proceed with testing

### Alternative: Secondary Physical Windows Machine

If VM not available:
- Use spare laptop/desktop
- Or test on primary machine (but requires uninstall/reinstall)
- Less ideal, but workable
