# ✅ Release Workflow Error Fixed

**Issue**: GitHub Actions Release workflow failed  
**Error**: "workflow is not reusable as it is missing a `on.workflow_call` trigger"  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - Release re-triggered**

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The release workflow (`release.yml`) was trying to call the CI workflow (`ci.yml`) using:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

But the CI workflow didn't have the `workflow_call` trigger, so GitHub couldn't call it as a reusable workflow.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Added**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:
  workflow_call:  # ← Added this line
```

This allows the workflow to be called by other workflows (the release workflow).

## 🔄 What Happened Next

1. ✅ Fixed CI workflow with `workflow_call` trigger
2. ✅ Pushed fix to main branch
3. ✅ Deleted old v1.0.0 tag (had incorrect workflow)
4. ✅ Deleted tag from GitHub
5. ✅ Recreated v1.0.0 tag
6. ✅ Pushed new tag to GitHub
7. ✅ Release workflow triggered again (should work now!)

## 📊 Current Status

**Release Workflow**: ⏳ Running  
**Expected Completion**: 5-10 minutes  
**Artifacts**: Will be available at v1.0.0 release page

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor GitHub Actions**
   ```

   Watch for "Release" workflow to complete with green checkmark ✅

2. **Check Releases Page**
   ```
   https://github.com/edemarest/RobloxGuard/releases/tag/v1.0.0
   ```
   Wait for artifacts to appear (EXE, Installer, Checksums)

3. **Download When Ready**
   - RobloxGuard.exe
   - RobloxGuardInstaller.exe
   - checksums.sha256

4. **Run 9 Test Scenarios**
