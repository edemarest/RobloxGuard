```

**Main now includes:**
- âœ… All analysis documents (QUICK_REFERENCE.md, REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- âœ… Current architecture documentation
- âœ… Discord notification refactor specification
- âœ… Implementation roadmap
- âœ… All original RobloxGuard v1.5.0 code

**Files added to main:**
1. `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Visual guide
2. `REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary
3. `ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md` - Completion status
4. `docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - Current system deep dive
5. `docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md` - Technical specification
6. `docs/REFACTOR_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Navigation guide

## What's on Discord Branch

Same as main (c69060b rebased):
- All analysis documentation
- Ready for Phase 1 implementation (configuration refactor)

---

## How to Use This Setup

### To Start Implementation:

```bash
# You're already on the discord branch!
git status
# On branch feature/discord-notification-monitor

# Start Phase 1: Modify RobloxGuardConfig.cs
# Reference: docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md
```

### To Switch Branches:

```bash
# Switch to main (production/documentation base)
git checkout main

# Switch to discord branch (development)
git checkout feature/discord-notification-monitor
```

### To Push Changes:

```bash
# From discord branch, commit changes
git add src/RobloxGuard.Core/RobloxGuardConfig.cs
git commit -m "Phase 1: Remove playtime settings from config"

# Push to github
git push origin feature/discord-notification-monitor

# When complete, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/discord-notification-monitor
git push origin main
```

## Documentation Structure

**Quick Start (5 minutes):**
â†’ Read `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**Full Understanding (30-90 minutes):**
1. `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (overview)
2. `docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (current system)
3. `docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md` (implementation)

**Implementation Guide:**
â†’ Follow `docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md` (phases 1-5)

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Begin Implementation Today
1. You're on `feature/discord-notification-monitor` branch âœ…
2. Read `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` to refresh
3. Start Phase 1: Configuration Refactor
4. Reference `docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md`

### Option 2: Study First, Code Later
1. Read `docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (understand current)
2. Read `docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md` (understand new)
3. Then start Phase 1 when ready

### Option 3: Review & Ask Questions
1. Check `docs/REFACTOR_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` for navigation
2. Review specific sections of the analysis
3. Ask questions before starting

## Key Files for Implementation

### Phase 1 (Config):
- `src/RobloxGuard.Core/RobloxGuardConfig.cs`

### Phase 2 (LogMonitor):
- `src/RobloxGuard.Core/LogMonitor.cs`

### Phase 3 (New Component):
- `src/RobloxGuard.Core/DiscordNotificationListener.cs` (create new)

### Phase 4 (Integration):
- `src/RobloxGuard.UI/Program.cs`

### Phase 5 (Cleanup):
- Delete: `src/RobloxGuard.Core/PlaytimeTracker.cs`
- Delete: `src/RobloxGuard.Core.Tests/PlaytimeTrackerTests.cs`
- Update: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Branch Strategy

```
main (production)
  â”œâ”€ All analysis documentation
  â”œâ”€ Clean, well-documented base
  â””â”€ Ready to merge discord branch when complete

feature/discord-notification-monitor (development)
  â”œâ”€ Starts with same analysis docs as main
  â”œâ”€ Implementation happens here (phases 1-5)
  â”œâ”€ Tests run and pass here
  â””â”€ Merged back to main when complete
```
